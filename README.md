# UpdatedPortfolio


Welcome to my portfolio! In this application, the user should be able to view my previous projects during my time at the University of Washington coding bootcamp.
In the nav bar, there are buttons that will allow the user to skip to the project and about me section on the page. 
There is also a contact button that will take the user to a seperate application to fill out their info and send me an email. 
My Github, Linkedin, and Resume are also linked in the nav bar.
